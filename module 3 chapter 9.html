            Valuation, in general, is the estimate of the ‘worth’ of something. In the context of investments,
            ‘something’ refers to the price of a stock. When making an investment decision, irrespective of how
            attractive the business appears, what matters finally is the business’s valuation. Valuations dictate the
            price you pay to acquire a business. Sometimes, a mediocre business at a ridiculously cheap valuation may be
            a great investment option instead of an exciting business with an extremely high valuation.
            <br><br>
            The valuation ratios help us develop a sense of how the market participants value the stock price. These
            ratios help us understand the attractiveness of the stock price from an investment perspective. The point of
            valuation ratios is to compare the price of a stock viz a viz the benefits of owning it. Like all the other
            ratios we had looked at, a company’s valuation ratios should be evaluated alongside the company’s
            competitors
            <br><br>
            Continuing with the Amara Raja Batteries Limited (ARBL) example, let us implement these ratios to see how
            ARBL fares. The stock price of ARBL is a vital input used to calculate the valuation ratios. As I write this
            chapter on 28th of Oct 2014, ARBL trades at Rs.661 per share.

            We also need the total number of shares outstanding in ARBL to calculate the above ratios. If you recollect,
            we have calculated the same in chapter 6. The total number of shares outstanding is 17,08,12,500 or
            17.081Crs
            <br><br>
            In many cases, investors may use sales instead of earnings to value their investments. The earnings figure may not be true as some companies might be experiencing a cyclical low in their earning cycle. Additionally, due to some accounting rules, a profitable company may seem to have no earnings at all, due to the huge write-offs applicable to that industry. So, investors would prefer to use this ratio. This ratio compares the stock price of the company with the company’s sales per share. The formula to calculate the P/S ratio is:
            <br><br>
            A P/S ratio of 3.24 times indicates that, for every Rs.1 of sales, the stock is valued Rs.3.24 times higher. Obviously, the higher the P/S ratio, the higher is the valuation of the firm. One has to compare the P/S ratio with its competitors to get a fair sense of how expensive or cheap the stock is.
