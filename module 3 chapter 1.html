            Fundamental Analysis (FA) is a holistic approach to study a business. When an investor wishes to invest in a
            business for the long term (say 3 – 5 years), it becomes essential to understand the business from various
            perspectives. It is critical for an investor to separate the daily short term noise in the stock prices and
            concentrate on the underlying business performance. Over the long term, a fundamentally strong company’s
            stock prices tend to appreciate, thereby creating wealth for its investors.
            <br><br>
            We have many such examples in the Indian market. To name a few, one can think of companies such as Infosys
            Limited, TCS Limited, Page Industries, Eicher Motors, Bosch India, Nestle India, TTK Prestige etc. Each of
            these companies has delivered an average over 20% compounded annual growth return (CAGR) year on year for
            over 10 years. At a 20% CAGR, the investor would double his money in roughly about 3.5 years to give you a
            perspective. Higher the CAGR faster is the wealth creation process. Some companies such as Bosch India
            Limited have delivered close to 30% CAGR. Therefore, you can imagine the magnitude and the speed at which
            wealth is created if one would invest in fundamentally strong companies.
            <br><br>
            Here are long term charts of Bosch India, Eicher Motors, and TCS Limited that can set you thinking about
            long term wealth creation. Do remember these are just 3 examples amongst the many that you may find in
            Indian markets.
            <br><br>
            At this point, you may think that I am biased as I am selectively posting charts that look impressive. You
            may wonder how the long term charts of companies such as Suzlon Energy, Reliance Power, and Sterling Biotech
            may look? Well here are the long term charts of these companies:

            <br><br>
            These are just 3 examples of the wealth destructors amongst the many you may find in the Indian Markets.
            <br><br>
            The trick has always been to separate the investment-grade companies which create wealth from the companies
            that destroy wealth. All investment-grade companies have a few common attributes that set them apart.
            Likewise, all wealth destructors have a few common traits which are clearly visible to an astute investor.

            Fundamental Analysis is the technique that gives you the conviction to invest for a long term by helping you
            identify these attributes of wealth-creating companies.

            Of course, you can be. It is a common misconception that only chartered accountants and professionals from commerce background can be good fundamental analysts. This is not true at all. A fundamental analyst adds 2 and 2 to ensure it sums up to 4. To become a fundamental analyst, you will need a few basic skills:
            <br><br>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Understanding the basic financial statements</li>
                <li>Understand businesses concerning the industry in which it operates</li>
                <li>Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            This module’s objective on Fundamental Analysis is to ensure that you gain the first two skill sets.
