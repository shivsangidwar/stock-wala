                                            stock market. Unfortunately, it lacks a definite answer. Any investment is
                                            subject to market risk, yet all stocks perform differently over time.
                                            Identifying good stocks from the vast range of stocks available can be
                                            tricky.

                                            However, looking at the fundamentals of the company in question serves as a
                                            valuable approach to potentially judge the viability of an investment
                                            decision. You can always look at how the company has been performing
                                            recently across multiple key performance indicators and see how these
                                            numbers compare with its peers.</div>

                                            capitalization is calculated on the basis of the total number of its
                                            outstanding shares in the market multiplied by the current price per share.

                                            For the mid-cap companies market capitalization lies between Rs 5,000 -
                                            20,000cr. Mid-cap companies are considerably smaller than large-cap

                                            all your eggs in one basket.” This quote stands true in the markets as well.
                                            Investing in only one or two sectors can be a risky bet. Economic / business
                                            cycles and multiple events can cause a sector to underperform in the broader
                                            markets. Hence, it is always advisable to invest in a mix of sectors. Even
                                            when you diversify investments across sectors, it is recommended to hold
                                            multiple stocks from each sector. You can thus minimise the risk associated

                                            of raising capital and transitioning a company into being publicly traded.
                                            Similar to stock investments, you should conduct adequate research before
                                            investing funds in an IPO.

                                            At the time of such an offering, companies come up with multiple details in
                                            their prospectus. These include recent financials, plans, use of proceeds,
                                            major shareholders, etc. Upon thoroughly reviewing the information, you can
                                            make an informed investment decision.

                                            IPOs frequently present promising opportunities, as numerous companies put
                                            out their IPOs at a lower valuation. This allows retail investors to invest

                                            volume. Breakout traders typically enter long positions after the share

                                            A breakdown in stock market is basically the opposite of a breakout. It is a

                                            of support, which signifies a further decline in the security price. Stock
                                            market breakdowns commonly occur on heavy volumes, and the resultant move
                                            lower tends to be relatively quick and severe in magnitude. Traders can

                                            never. You should never put all your investment in one stock. The best
                                            option is to diversify your investment portfolio by carefully picking a
                                            variety of stocks, different companies, different stock types, and different
                                            sectors. The diversification of the investment portfolio will minimise the
                                            risk. In case you invest in one stock, your risk profile is at the maximum
                                            as all your investment can be lost if the stock company shares trade badly
                                            or crash.

                                        <div class="accordion-body">You can track the performance of your portfolio by
                                            checking the holdings in your Demat Account. Key aspects to consider include
                                            identifying the stocks contributing to your returns and pinpointing areas of
                                            concern.

                                            On a broader scale, you should see if the average return generated by your
                                            portfolio is above / below the performance of the major indices like Nifty
                                            50. It is crucial to keep track, since by actively tracking your portfolio,
                                            you can reposition your investments based on market fluctuations.

                                            Investing in the stock market requires knowledge and experience. You should
                                            research the company you are investing in thoroughly before making an
                                            investment decision.</div>
