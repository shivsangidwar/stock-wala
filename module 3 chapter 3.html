            The annual report (AR) is a yearly publication by the company and is sent to the shareholders and other
            interested parties. The annual report is published by the end of the Financial Year, and all the data made
            available in the annual report is dated to 31st March. The AR is usually available on the company’s website
            (in the investor’s section) as a PDF document, or one can contact the company to get a hard copy of the
            same.
            <br><br>
            Since the company’s annual report, whatever is mentioned in the AR is assumed to be official. Hence, any
            misrepresentation of facts in the annual report can be held against the company. To give you a perspective,
            AR contains the auditor’s certificates (signed, dated, and sealed) certifying the sanctity of the financial
            data included in the annual report.
            <br><br>
            Potential investors and the present shareholders are the primary audiences for the annual report.  Annual reports should provide the most pertinent information to an investor and communicate its primary message. For an investor, the annual report must be the default option to seek information about a company. Of course, many media websites claim to give financial information about the company; however, the investors should avoid seeking information from such sources. Remember the information is more reliable if we get it to get it directly from the annual report.
            <br><br>
            Why would the media website misrepresent the company information you may ask? Well, they may not do it deliberately, but they may be forced to do it due to other factors. For example, the company may like to include ‘depreciation’ in the expense side of P&L, but the media website may like to include it under a separate header. While this would not impact the overall numbers, it does interrupt the overall sequencing of data.

            <br><br>
            The annual report has many sections that contain useful information about the company. One has to be careful while going through the annual report as there is a fragile line between the company’s facts and the marketing content that the company wants you to read.
            <br><br>
            To better understand, I would urge you to download the Annual Report of ARBL and go through it simultaneously as we progress through this chapter.

                <li>The Annual Report (AR) of a company is an official communication from the company to its investors and other stakeholders.</li>
                <li>The AR is the best source to get information about the company; hence AR should be the default choice for the investor to source company-related information.</li>
                <li>The AR contains many sections, with each section highlighting a certain aspect of the business.</li>
                <li>The AR is also the best source to get information related to the qualitative aspects of the company.</li>
                <li>The management discussion and analysis is one of the most important sections in the AR. It has the management’s perspective on the country’s overall economy, their outlook on the industry they operate in for the year gone by (what went right and what went wrong), and what they foresee for the year ahead.</li>
                <li>The AR contains three financial statements – Profit & Loss Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow statement.</li>
                <li>The standalone statement contains the financial numbers of only the company into consideration. However, the consolidated numbers contain the company and its subsidiaries financial numbers.</li>
