            Over the last few chapters, we understood how to read the financial statements and calculate a few important financial ratios. These chapters have laid the foundation for this module’s final objective: – To use fundamental analysis to identify the stocks to invest. If you recollect in the earlier chapters, we had discussed investable grade attributes. Investable grade attributes define a company’s prerequisites that need to be validated before making an investment decision.  Think of the investable grade attributes as a checklist based on the fundamentals of the company. A company that satisfies most of the items in the checklist is considered investment-worthy.
            <br><br>
            Now, this is where few differences come up. For instance, what I consider as an investable grade attribute may not be so important to you. For example, – I may pay a lot of attention to corporate governance, but another investor may choose not to pay so much attention to corporate governance. He could brush it off saying “all companies have shades of grey, as long as the numbers add up I am fine investing in the company”.
            <br><br>
            So the point is, there is no prescribed checklist. Each investor has to build his own checklist based on his investment experience. However, one has to ensure that each item on the checklist is qualified based on sound logic. Later in this chapter, I will share a checklist that I think is reasonably well-curated. You could take pointers from this checklist if you are starting fresh. We will keep this checklist as a guideline and proceed further in this module.
            <br><br>
            Now before we proceed further and generate a checklist, we must address a more basic issue. The process of investing requires us first to select a stock that looks interesting. After selecting the stock, we must subject it to the checklist to figure out if the stock matches all the checklist criteria, if it does we invest, we look for other opportunities.
            <br><br>
            So in the first place, how do we even select a stock that looks interesting? In other words, how do we generate a list of stocks that seems interesting enough to investigate further? Well, there are a few methods to do this –
