            A maker prepares financial statements. He is typically a person with an accounting background. His job involves preparing ledger entries, matching bills and receipts, tallying the inflows versus the outflows, auditing etc. The final objective is to prepare transparent financial statements that best represent the company’s true financial position. To prepare such a financial statement, certain skills are required. Usually, these skills are developed through the rigour of a Chartered Accountant’s training program.

            On the other hand, the user just needs to be in a position to understand what the maker has prepared. He is just the user of the financial statements. He need not really know the details of the journal entries or the audit procedure. His main concern is to read what is being stated and use it to make his decisions.

            To put this in context, think about Google. Most of us do not understand Google’s complex search engine algorithm that runs in the backend. However, we all know how to use Google effectively. Such is the distinction between the maker and the user of financial statements.

            There are three main financial statements that a company showcases to represent its performance.
            <br><br>
            The Profit and Loss statement is also popularly referred to as the P&L statement, Income Statement, Statement of Operations, and Statement of Earnings. The Profit and Loss statement shows what has transpired during a time period.  The P&L statement reports information on:

            From my experience, the financial statements are best understood by looking at the actual statement and figuring out the information. Hence, here is the P&L statement of Amara Raja Batteries Limited (ARBL). Let us understand every line item.

            You may have heard analysts talk about the top line of a company. When they do so, they are referring to the revenue side of the P&L statement. The revenue side is the first set of numbers the company presents in the P&L.
