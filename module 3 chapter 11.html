            Having set the context in the previous chapter, we will now develop a methodology for conducting a ‘limited
            resource’ equity research. The reason why I call it ‘limited resource’ is because you and I, as a retail
            investor, have access to just a few resources to conduct equity research. These resources are – internet,
            company annual report, and MS Excel. Whilst an Institution has access to human resource (analyst), access to
            company management, financial database (such as Bloomberg, Reuters, Factset etc.), industry reports etc. So
            my objective here is to demonstrate how one can better understand a company and its business with the
            limited resources at hand. Of course, we will do this exercise keeping the end objective in perspective,
            i.e., deciding whether to buy or not to buy a stock.
            <br><br>
            When we take up a company for research, the first step is to understand the business as much as possible.
            People often miss this crucial step and go directly into the stock price analysis. Well, just analyzing the
            stock price is great if you have a short term perspective. However, for long term investments, understanding
            the business is essential.
            <br><br>
            Why is it important you may wonder? Well, the reason is simple: the more you know the company, the higher is
            your conviction to stay put with the investment, especially during bad times (aka bear markets). Remember,
            during bear markets, the prices react and not the business fundamentals. Understanding the company and its
            business well gives you the required conviction to reason why it makes sense to stay invested in the stock
            even though the market may think otherwise. They say bear markets creates value, so if you have a high
            conviction on the company, you should consider buying into the stock during bear markets and not really
            selling the stock. Needless to say, this is highly counter-intuitive, and it takes years of investment
            practice to internalize this fact.
            <br><br>
            Anyway, moving ahead the best source to get information related to the business is the company’s website and
            its annual report. We need to study at least the last 5-year annual report to understand how it is evolving
            across business cycles.


            <br><br>
            As a first step towards understanding the business, we need to make a list of questions we need to find
            answers to. Do note, the answers to all these questions can be found out by reading through the company’s
            annual report and website.

            Here are a bunch of questions that I think helps us in our quest to understand the business. I have
            discussed the rationale behind each question.
